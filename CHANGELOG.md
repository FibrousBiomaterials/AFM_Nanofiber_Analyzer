# Changelog

All notable changes to AFM Nanofiber Analyzer are documented in this file.

The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Commit- and push-time safety checks (`.githooks/pre-commit`,
  `.githooks/pre-push`, `scripts/check_sensitive.py`) that scan staged diffs
  and outgoing commits for credentials, e-mail addresses, machine-local
  absolute paths, and a locally defined block list before anything is
  published; enable once per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
  (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
- A commit-time changelog check (`scripts/check_changelog.py`, run from
  `.githooks/pre-commit`) that blocks a change to the strict-regression
  goldens — that is, a change to the numbers the pipeline produces — unless the
  same commit records it under `## [Unreleased]` here.

### Fixed

- Skeleton traces no longer bend away from the fiber centerline at the ends of
  fibers that leave the field of view. Thinning treated everything outside the
  image array as background, so a fiber crossing the scan border became a shape
  cut flat by the edge, and the medial axis of that truncated end turned toward
  the nearer corner of the cut. Thinning now runs on a border-replicated copy
  of the mask (`thin_ignoring_image_border` in `lib/skeletonizer.py`). Measured
  against the distance transform of the border-replicated mask — the definition
  of how deep inside the fiber a pixel lies — the mean depth of skeleton pixels
  within 12 px of the border rises from 3.4-3.6 px to 4.0-4.3 px on the bundled
  scans, matching the 3.9-4.5 px seen away from the border. The pixels this
  drops sat 2.6-2.7 px deep, that is, on the edge of the fiber mask.
  Skeleton pixels away from the border are unchanged, and a per-component
  fallback keeps the previous result for any mask blob that lies along the
  border rather than crossing it, so no fiber is lost to the correction.
  Preprocessing outputs (`skeletonized`, `bp`, `ep`, `kp`, `dp`, `ka`) therefore
  change for fibers that touch the scan border; `calibrated` and `binarized` are
  unaffected. Re-run GUI01 or `cli.py process` to refresh existing `.b2z`
  bundles.
- Branch pruning no longer deletes the tip of a fiber that merely continues
  past its local search window. `Skeletonizer.track_branches` traced each
  candidate arm inside a `2 * branch_length` crop, so once the walk reached the
  crop edge the neighborhood read as empty, the "dead end" rule fired, and up
  to `branch_length` pixels were removed from a real fiber — with no height
  gate, so it applied to fibers far above `bp_height`. The walk now covers the
  whole image with explicit bounds checks. Each walk also carries its own
  visited set instead of blanking pixels in one shared working image, so the
  result no longer depends on the order endpoints happen to be processed in.
  Across the bundled scans and all four `bg_method` values this only restores
  pixels (0 to 211 per image) that were previously over-deleted; it removes
  nothing new.
- Feature overlays in GUI01 are no longer mirrored vertically **when the scale
  display is enabled**. Endpoint, branch-point, kink and decomposition markers
  were placed by scaling pixel indices with `scale / (n - 1)`, but `imshow`
  draws row 0 at the top of an `extent` whose y axis runs upward, so the
  markers were reflected about the image center. With the scale display off —
  the default — panels are drawn in pixel coordinates and the overlay was
  already correct, which is why this went unnoticed: it needed both a
  non-default overlay mode and the scale display switched on. Measured on the
  bundled tunicate scan, none of the drawn endpoint markers fell on a skeleton
  pixel with the scale display on; now all of them do, in both display modes.
  Both the 2x2 preview and the enlarged single-file view are corrected.
- Overlays now sit at pixel centers rather than half a pixel up and to the
  left. `imshow` spreads an image of `w` columns across the extent, so the
  center of column `c` is at `(c + 0.5) * scale / w`; GUI01, GUI02 and GUI04
  all placed overlay geometry at the pixel's upper-left corner instead. In
  GUI04 this shifted the fiber track, kink markers and the color-coded fiber
  scatter by half a pixel against the height image.
- GUI02 height profiles are now sampled from the pixel that was clicked. The
  micrometer-to-index conversion omitted the same half-pixel term, so
  `profile_line` read half a pixel down and to the right of the marked points.
  **Extracted profile values change from this version.** The sampling-width
  band drawn on the heatmap is unchanged on screen — it always followed the
  marked points — but it now agrees with the pixels actually sampled, which it
  previously missed by that same half pixel.
- GUI07 overlays are centered on their pixels too. The annotator was built on
  GUI04 and inherited the same upper-left placement, so the fiber track, the
  kink markers on both the overview and the single-fiber view, the filtered and
  color-coded fiber scatters, and the connection lines were all drawn half a
  pixel up and to the left. The connection lines are only shifted where they
  are drawn: the endpoint coordinates recorded in a connection label file stay
  integer pixel indices, so existing label files still match. Fiber bounding
  boxes are unchanged — a box edge belongs at the pixel boundary, not its
  center.
- `run_venv.bat` now checks the Python version before building the `.venv`, and
  both launchers point at the download page when no supported Python is found.
  The Windows launcher only tested that the `py` launcher answered at all, so a
  machine with Python 3.9 passed the check, created a `.venv`, and then failed
  inside pip with a `requires-python` message that never mentioned Python's
  version; a machine with `python.exe` on PATH but no `py` launcher was told to
  install Python it already had. The launcher now takes the first of `py -3` and
  `python` that satisfies the `>=3.10` floor from `pyproject.toml` — skipping
  the Windows App Execution Alias stub, which opens the Microsoft Store instead
  of running Python — and otherwise reports the version it found, or that it
  found none, followed by <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. `run_venv.sh`
  already enforced the floor and now reports the rejected version and suggests
  the distribution package manager on Linux, with python.org as the fallback.
- The `run_conda` launchers point at the conda installers when conda is not
  found, instead of only naming Anaconda/Miniconda. They need no Python check:
  `conda create` installs its own Python into the prefix, so conda itself is
  the only prerequisite these launchers can be missing.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-08

Initial public release, prepared for subsequent archival on Zenodo and
submission to the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).

### Added

- tkinter plugin launcher (`Main.py`) with four interactive tools: Image
  Preprocessor (GUI01), Plot Profiler (GUI02), Fiber Height Histogram (GUI03),
  and Fiber Tracker (GUI04).
- GUI-independent preprocessing pipeline (`lib/pipeline.py`) shared by GUI01 and
  the CLI, covering background calibration, segmentation, skeletonization, and
  kink detection.
- AFM input through auto-detected text/CSV layouts and native, multi-channel
  Gwyddion `.gwy` files with topography-channel auto-selection.
- Command-line interface (`cli.py`) with `process`, `validate`, `measure`,
  `heights`, `export`, and `show-params` subcommands.
- Single-bundle output format (`.b2z`) with an executable, versioned schema
  (`lib/bundle_schema.py`) validated at write and load time, alongside a
  per-input parameter JSON file and spatial-calibration metadata.
- GUI-independent fiber measurement (`lib/measure.py`) shared by GUI03, GUI04,
  and the CLI, so GUI and CLI statistics are identical.
- Background calibration with four interchangeable methods: `inpaint`, `tophat`,
  `spline1d`, and `spline2d`.
- Localization through gettext, with English, Japanese, and Chinese catalogs.
- Editable install via `pyproject.toml`, a loose `requirements.txt`, and a
  test-verified `requirements.lock.txt`.
- Continuous integration (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) running Ruff lint,
  `check.py --verify`, and the pytest suite on Windows and Linux across two
  Python versions.
- Project documentation: `README.md` / `README.ja.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SUPPORT.md`, maintainer notes, docstring templates, and a JOSS paper
  (`paper.md`).
