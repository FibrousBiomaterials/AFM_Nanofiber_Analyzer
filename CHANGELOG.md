# Changelog

All notable changes to AFM Nanofiber Analyzer are documented in this file.

The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Commit- and push-time safety checks (`.githooks/pre-commit`,
  `.githooks/pre-push`, `scripts/check_sensitive.py`) that scan staged diffs
  and outgoing commits for credentials, e-mail addresses, machine-local
  absolute paths, and a locally defined block list before anything is
  published; enable once per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
  (see CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Fixed

- Skeleton traces no longer bend away from the fiber centerline at the ends of
  fibers that leave the field of view. Thinning treated everything outside the
  image array as background, so a fiber crossing the scan border became a shape
  cut flat by the edge, and the medial axis of that truncated end turned toward
  the nearer corner of the cut. Thinning now runs on a border-replicated copy
  of the mask (`thin_ignoring_image_border` in `lib/skeletonizer.py`), which
  reduced the measured lateral offset between the trace and the height ridge at
  border ends from about 1.9-2.1 px to about 0.8-1.0 px on the bundled scans.
  Skeleton pixels away from the border are unchanged, and a per-component
  fallback keeps the previous result for any mask blob that lies along the
  border rather than crossing it, so no fiber is lost to the correction.
  Preprocessing outputs (`skeletonized`, `bp`, `ep`, `kp`, `dp`, `ka`) therefore
  change for fibers that touch the scan border; `calibrated` and `binarized` are
  unaffected. Re-run GUI01 or `cli.py process` to refresh existing `.b2z`
  bundles.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-08

Initial public release, prepared for subsequent archival on Zenodo and
submission to the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).

### Added

- tkinter plugin launcher (`Main.py`) with four interactive tools: Image
  Preprocessor (GUI01), Plot Profigit
- GUI-independent preprocessing pipeline (`lib/pipeline.py`) shared by GUI01 and
  the CLI, covering background calibration, segmentation, skeletonization, and
  kink detection.
- AFM input through auto-detected text/CSV layouts and native, multi-channel
  Gwyddion `.gwy` files with topography-channel auto-selection.
- Command-line interface (`cli.py`) with `process`, `validate`, `measure`,
  `heights`, `export`, and `show-params` subcommands.
- Single-bundle output format (`.b2z`) with an executable, versioned schema
  (`lib/bundle_schema.py`) validated at write and load time, alongside a
  per-input parameter JSON file and spatial-calibration metadata.
- GUI-independent fiber measurement (`lib/measure.py`) shared by GUI03, GUI04,
  and the CLI, so GUI and CLI statistics are identical.
- Background calibration with four interchangeable methods: `inpaint`, `tophat`,
  `spline1d`, and `spline2d`.
- Localization through gettext, with English, Japanese, and Chinese catalogs.
- Editable install via `pyproject.toml`, a loose `requirements.txt`, and a
  test-verified `requirements.lock.txt`.
- Continuous integration (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) running Ruff lint,
  `check.py --verify`, and the pytest suite on Windows and Linux across two
  Python versions.
- Project documentation: `README.md` / `README.ja.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `SUPPORT.md`, maintainer notes, docstring templates, and a JOSS paper
  (`paper.md`).
